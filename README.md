## An Introduction to the Department {#anintroductiontothedepartment}

Humankind has always faced significant challenges. With today\'s
technology, however, we have the ability to collect vast amounts of data
to illuminate the problems and opportunities we face. More importantly,
we now can apply an array of robust analytical tools to deepen our
understanding of the issues, to help us make better decisions and to
develop solutions that will enhance our quality-of-life.

While collecting vast amounts of data is becoming easier, collecting the
right data remains very expensive. How does one get from vast data to
the right data? How should one analyze, understand and appropriately
address uncertainty that is present in essentially all societal
endeavors? And, how can one exploit these resources to make the best
possible decisions and best contribute to an enhanced quality-of-life?
These are precisely the questions that form the core of the Department
of Operations Research and Financial Engineering. Problems of this kind
have appeared for a long time in the understanding of logistics and
management, energy, the environment, agriculture, the military and
micro- and macro-economics. As our ability to handle more data and
complexity has expanded, so has our ability to more deeply address
traditional applications and venture to tackle new ones in finance,
health care, biology and most aspects of our society. The basic
mathematical modeling and analytic skills that lie at the heart of ORFE
are now essential prerequisites to almost any quantitative discipline,
including areas such as data science and statistics, information
technology, energy resource management, health care, risk management,
and many others. We view ORFE as the ideal quantitative education for
the modern world, whether you see your future as a business leader,
health care provider, legal/policy/political professional, data
scientist, quantitative analyst, or academic researcher. Even poets
might find something to love in ORFE.

ORFE is the intersection of six closely interconnected applied
mathematical disciplines and application areas that lie at the heart of
all activities in the Department: operations research, financial
engineering, machine learning, optimization, statistics and probability.
Each of these areas is described in more detail below.

### Operations Research

The field of operations research traces its foundations to World War II,
although it includes dimensions that go as far back as the early days of
the telephone at the beginning of the 20th century. It uses mathematical
models and optimization methods to rigorously address quantitative
problems in business and management, logistics, health care, energy
systems, telecommunications, and transportation. The most common theme
that runs through these problems is the efficient management of
resources, where resources may be natural resources, economic resources,
informational resources, equipment, people, and/or physical facilities.
Students in operations research may follow a management track into
business or consulting, or a more technical path into teaching,
research, or software development. There is a burgeoning marketplace for
sophisticated methods to schedule airlines and railroads or to optimize
supply chains for large manufacturing and retail enterprises.

### Financial Engineering

Financial engineering uses mathematical models of financial markets to
design innovative financial instruments and strategies to meet the
specific needs of individuals and corporations, including managing risks
and cash flows. To this end, financial engineers analyze and ultimately
manage risks within an integrated framework, as compared with
traditional piecemeal approaches. Often, new instruments are constructed
based on the specific requirements of the investor. Solving these
problems in a principled manner requires a combination of diverse
analytical methods from applied mathematics, probability and statistics,
stochastic processes and stochastic calculus, optimization, financial
economics, and computation skills. Students grounded in financial
engineering are in great demand: they find jobs on Wall Street and with
traditional financial companies such as banks, insurance companies,
mutual funds, and financial consulting companies, as well as in the CFO
office within mainline corporations.

### Machine Learning

Financial engineering uses mathematical models of financial markets to
design innovative financial instruments and strategies to meet the
specific needs of individuals and corporations, including managing risks
and cash flows. To this end, financial engineers analyze and ultimately
manage risks within an integrated framework, as compared with
traditional piecemeal approaches. Often, new instruments are constructed
based on the specific requirements of the investor. Solving these
problems in a principled manner requires a combination of diverse
analytical methods from applied mathematics, probability and statistics,
stochastic processes and stochastic calculus, optimization, financial
economics, and computation skills. Students grounded in financial
engineering are in great demand: they find jobs on Wall Street and with
traditional financial companies such as banks, insurance companies,
mutual funds, and financial consulting companies, as well as in the CFO
office within mainline corporations.

### Optimization

Optimization is everywhere. Whether one talks about optimizing revenue,
finding the best route to visit all the major cities of the United
States, or optimizing the parameters of your new algorithm, there is
common thread: one wants to design procedures that can rapidly and
accurately optimize a given function of interest. The area of
mathematical programming is concerned with the design and analysis of
such procedures. At ORFE we are particularly interested in large-scale
time-varying optimization problems, involving substantial uncertainty
and variability. Indeed these problems are more and more important in
our \"Big Data\" era. We also pay special attention to the interplay
between optimization and the domain specificity of the applications,
whether it is finance, statistics or machine learning. The cutting-edge
domain specific algorithms for large-scale optimization are nowadays
critical to the success of most IT companies, this include Google\'s
search engine or Netflix\'s recommendation system.

### Statistics

Statistics is the science of learning from data. Learning what? Well,
almost anything: Statistics are behind drug discovery, political
campaigns, climate policies, genetic screenings, financial portfolio
management and quality control to name only a few. If your senior thesis
involves data, statistics will be your best friend. Statistics is a
universal framework to make decisions based on data. In the "Big Data"
era, statistics is more relevant than ever: it allows us to make
predictions and understand the inherent uncertainty associated to these
predictions. Moreover, using modern computer resources, statisticians
have been able to contemplate richer models that fit better to reality
and make ground breaking scientific discoveries, for example in
understanding the human genome.

Hal Varian, the chief economist of Google, has famously said that the
statisticians have the sexiest job of the 21st century. One advantage of
working in statistics is that you can combine your interest with almost
any other field in science, health, technology, or business. Most
organizations now collect huge amounts of data and need statisticians to
extract relevant information from them.

### Probability

Probability theory, also known as stochastics, is the mathematics of
randomness and uncertainty. Probabilistic models lie at the heart of any
application that involves uncertain outcomes, be it the arrival of
patients and the availability of beds in hospitals, the fluctuations of
financial markets, the spread of epidemics, the inheritance of genetic
traits, and numerous other applications that span engineering and the
sciences. They also provide the fundamental framework for modeling the
structure of complex data, and form the foundation of statistical
methods for analyzing text, speech, and biological data. At the same
time, randomness can serve as an important resource for solving
otherwise intractable problems, including simulation methods for
estimating risks or for tracking and prediction in uncertain systems,
random measurements for exploring customer preferences and for speeding
up data acquisition in signal processing, and stochastic optimization
algorithms for making optimal decisions on the basis of noisy data.
Probability theory provides the tools needed to design and analyze such
models and methods and to rigorously understand their behavior.

## Overview of the Undergraduate Academic Program {#overviewoftheundergraduateacademicprogram}

In addition to meeting the usual Engineering School requirements,
students will complete courses in the following four groups:

-   Department's core requirements (4 courses) -- These form the
    intellectual foundation of our field, and cover statistics,
    probability, stochastic processes, and optimization.

-   Departmental electives (10 or 11 courses depending on senior thesis
    choice) - These are additional courses that either extend and
    broaden the core, or expose the student to a significant problem
    area or application closely related to the core program.

### Independent Research

Senior Thesis - ORF 478 - A full year effort that involves a major
application of the techniques in the program applied to a topic that a
student chooses in consultation with a faculty adviser. Students
interested in a full-year senior thesis must be willing to spend the
appropriate time during both the fall and the spring semesters. Students
who are unable to make adequate progress can switch to ORF 479 and be
required to take eleven departmental electives. Students will enroll in
the spring and will receive credit for two course grades given in the
spring.

OR

Senior Independent Project - ORF 479 (Spring semester only) - A short
progress report will be due in December, (Dean's Date) to make sure that
the students have chosen a suitable topic and matched up with their
adviser. The final outcome will be a report due at the end of the spring
semester. The report will fully describe the research project and its
results. Typically projects will take approximately 30 to 50 pages.
Students who take the independent project will need to take an
additional 400-level ORFE departmental elective.

A minimum of 7 courses from the humanities and social sciences. These
courses must include 1 course in 4 of the following areas:

-   Epistemology and Cognition (EC)
-   Ethical Thought and Moral Values (EM)
-   Historical Analysis (HA)
-   Literature and the Arts (LA)
-   Social Analysis (SA)
-   Foreign Language (107/108 level or above) • Culture and Difference
    (CD)

The University requires that 36 courses be taken to graduate. The School
of Engineering requires math achievement through Math (MAT 103, 104, 201
and 202, or equivalent), Computer Science proficiency (COS 126),
Chemistry (CHM 201 or 207) and Physics (PHY 103, 104).  Ten courses
required to meet the engineering school requirement of 36 courses (more
if the student places out of any of the SEAS requirements). Students are
free to select these courses from any department, and are expected to
design an academic program with the assigned adviser that produces a
balanced education. No course may count under more than one heading,
under any circumstances.

Each student selects and schedules courses in consultation with his/her
academic adviser and the Director of Undergraduate Studies. While
generally no exceptions in the core courses are allowed, students may
design specialized programs through their choice of departmental
electives. Specialized programs must be approved by the Director of
Undergraduate Studies.

### Graduate Courses

Graduate courses may be taken for the purpose of scholarly enrichment,
and ORF graduate courses will apply as departmental electives. To
enroll, one must complete the "Permission for Undergraduates to Enroll
in Graduate Courses" form with signatures from the course instructor,
Director of Undergraduate Studies, and Dean Bogucki. The completed form
is submitted to the Office of the Registrar during open enrollment
period. Graduate courses will not count toward departmental GPA
computations. The [necessary
form](https://registrar.princeton.edu/student-and-alumni-services/course-selection/adding-or-dropping-courses)
may be found via the Registrar.

### ABET Accredited Engineering Degrees

The Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering does not
offer ABET- accredited engineering degrees. This has never been a
problem for ORFE majors in their pursuit of post-graduate opportunities,
and our B.S.E. degrees are fully accredited under Princeton University's
overall accreditation. If, however, it is important that you major in an
ABET-accredited program of study (e.g. for eligibility for an outside
scholarship), please take this into account when choosing your major.
Further information on which Princeton program of study are
ABET-accredited, please consult [the Undergraduate
Announcement](https://ua.princeton.edu/).

## Academic Program Details {#academicprogramdetails}

### SEAS Requirements {#seasrequirements}

MAT 103, 104; COS 126; CHM 201 or 207; PHY 103 or 105, 104 or 106; MAT
201 or 203, 202 or 204 or 217

### ORFE Requirements {#coreprogram}

### Core Program (4 Courses)

#### ORF 245 Fundamentals of Engineering Statistics\*\*

A first introduction to probability and statistics. This course will
provide background to understand and produce rigorous statistical
analysis including estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing
and regression and classification. Applicability and limitations of
these methods will be illustrated using a variety of modern real world
data sets and manipulation of the statistical software R. MAT 201
concurrent or equivalent or approved by instructor.

\*\*Placement Exam option. Some students may have substantial prior
knowledge of engineering statistics. For them, the "Core Requirement"
aspects of ORF 245, Fundamentals of Engineering Statistics, can be
satisfied by a "core-requirement exam". The 3-hour exam is administered
in January to student(s) who have applied to the ORFE Director of
Undergraduate Studies prior to the previous December 1 for permission to
take the exam, and received authorization by the ORF 245 Exam Committee.
The application should clearly state (including supporting
documentation) why the student feels they already have a firm grasp of
the Fundamentals of Engineering Statistics. Note: passing the exam
satisfies the "Core Requirement of ORF 245" but does not contribute a
course to the BSE degree's "36 courses" requirement and it increases
ORFE's "Departmental Elective" requirement from 10 to 11, one of which
must now be an advanced statistics course. In short, the "Core
Requirement" for statistics can be satisfied by either taking and
passing ORF 245 or for those with sufficient advanced knowledge, passing
the ORF 245 exam and passing an advanced statistics course. (The exam
option was added to the Academic Guide effective 8/1/2021).

#### ORF 307 Optimization

This course focuses on analytical and computational tools for
optimization. We will introduce least-squares optimization with multiple
objectives and constraints. We will also discuss linear optimization
modeling, duality, the simplex method, degeneracy, interior point
methods and network flow optimization. Finally, we will cover integer
programming and branch-and-bound algorithms. A broad spectrum of
real-world applications in engineering, finance and statistics is
presented. Prerequisite: MAT 202 or 204. It is strongly recommended that
COS 126 or equivalent be taken prior to or concurrently with this
course.

#### ORF 309 Probability and Stochastic Systems

An introduction to probability and its applications. Topics include:
basic principles of probability; Lifetimes and reliability, Poisson
processes; random walks; Brownian motion; branching processes; Markov
chains. Prerequisite: MAT 201, or instructor\'s permission.

#### ORF 335 Introduction to Financial Mathematics (also ECO 364)

Financial Mathematics is concerned with designing and analyzing products
that improve the efficiency of markets, and create mechanisms for
reducing risk. This course develops quantitative methods for these
goals: the notions of arbitrage and risk-neutral pricing in discrete
time, specific models such as Black-Scholes and Heston in continuous
time, and calibration to market data. Credit derivatives, the term
structure of interest rates, and robust techniques in the context of
volatility options will be discussed, as well as lessons from the
financial crisis. Prerequisites: MAT 104, ORF 309.

### Department Electives (10 or 11 Courses) {#departmentelectives}

### Junior Independent Work (Optional) {#juniorindependentwork}

Students selecting Junior Independent Work need to prepare a proposal
including the following:

1.  Title
2.  100 word abstract/literature. Abstract will describe the problem,
    why it is important, why you want to study it and what you hope to
    have accomplish by the end of the semester .
3.  \"Syllabus\" containing weekly readings and work plan. What you will
    focus on and what you plan to accomplish in each week of the
    semester.
4.  Table of contents of the final report that you will prepare that
    will form the basis of the grade that you will receive.
5.  Find a faculty member that will supervise you in the pursuit of the
    above.
6.  Obtain Director of Undergraduate Studies' approval of what you have
    put together in response to the above.

The proposal and signed Junior Independent Study Form must be submitted
to the Undergraduate Administrator (Caitlin Daley,
cdreyer@princeton.edu) prior to enrollment during the registrar's open
enrollment period. The requirements for satisfactory completion of the
study (such as reports, examinations, etc.) are set by the faculty
mentor, not the Department, and the student should be clear about them
when the work is begun.

### Senior Independent Work

### Senior Thesis (ORF 478) {#seniorthesisorf478}

This begins in the spring semester in the junior year, with a selection
process to ensure that students are matched with a faculty member based
on the preferences of the students.

Students interested in a full-year senior thesis must be willing to
spend the appropriate time during both the fall and the spring
semesters. Two course grades will be given in the spring.

Students who are unable to make adequate progress can switch to the
Senior Independent Project in September of the senor year (below), but
must take an eleventh departmental elective at the 400- level.

Three reports are required leading up to the final thesis report, which
is due in April. The first report is due in September, the second in
October, and the third in February. The research results will be
presented to faculty and students at the end of the spring semester. For
more information refer to the [senior thesis
guide](https://orfe.princeton.edu/documents/senior-thesis-guide) 

### Senior Independent Project (ORF 479, Spring Semester Only) {#seniorindependentprojectorf479springsemesteronly}

Students will choose an adviser during junior year, spring semester,
based on the usual arrangement -- attending presentations by the ORFE
faculty, reading the Faculty Interests Guide and meeting with individual
faculty members. Students will select a broad topic, and rank faculty
according to their preferences.

A short progress report will be due by Dean's Date of the fall
semester, to make sure that the students have chosen a suitable topic
and matched up with their adviser. The final outcome will be a report
due at the end of the spring semester. The report will fully describe
the research project and its results. Typically projects will take
approximately 30 to 50 pages. If selecting this option, students will
need to take an additional 400-level ORF course, for a total of eleven
electives.

### Departmental GPA, Honors and Prizes {#departmentalgpahonorsandprizes}

**Departmental GPA**: Prior to graduation, the department will calculate
each student\'s Departmental Grade Point Average (GPA). The Departmental
GPA is computed as the average of 15 grades. For students choosing the
2-semester Senior Thesis option (ORF 478) the 15 grades are: the thesis,
the best ten qualified departmentals, plus each of the core courses
except ORF 245. To be a qualified departmental the courses must satisfy
the following constraints: must be a member of the departmentals
electives list (pages 8 & 9) in the Academic Guide, no more than three
can be from one department. Each of these courses must have been taken
for a grade at Princeton (meaning no PDF). Courses taken at other
institutions will not be counted. If 15 graded courses meeting the
criteria do not exist because some requirement was met with courses
taken at other institutions, then other technical graded courses taken
at Princeton will be used to calculate a GPA.

For students choosing the 1-semester Senior Independent Research option
it is the same as above with an additional ORF 4XX departmental,
totaling 11 departmentals. Note, while two 200-level courses may be
included among the Departmental Electives, no 200- level courses are
counted in the departmental GPA (except COS 217, COS 226, and MAE 206).

A minimum 2.0 Departmental GPA is required for graduation. The
departmental GPA is a significant factor but not sole determinant of
honors. The overall academic quality of the entire ORFE class and
academic performance in individual classes are also taken into account
in the faculty\'s decision in awarding honors.

**Graduation Requirement**: Core Courses and Departmental
Electives **may not be taken on a PDF (Pass, D, Fail)
basis**. Equivalent versions may be taken at other universities but
require prior formal written permission. Grades received in courses
taken at other universities are not included in the computation of the
departmental GPA. A passing grade must be received in each ORFE Core
Course and each Departmental Elective. To graduate, a student must
satisfy the University\'s 36 course requirement, the SEAS requirements
for Physics, Chemistry, Math and Computer Science, ORFE\'s Core and
Departmental Elective requirement and achieve a Departmental GPA of 2.0
or greater.

**Honors**: Highest Honors, High Honors and Honors are awarded by the
ORFE faculty to those graduating seniors who have demonstrated the
highest levels of academic achievement. Departmental GPA is the major
criterion; however, each student\'s overall academic record and overall
quality of the entire class are also considered in the awarding of these
honors.

**Prizes**: The ORFE faculty also awards a few individual prizes for
specific superior achievement in a few defined categories.

### Certificates of Interest to ORFE Students and Other Opportunities {#certificatesofinteresttoorfestudentsandotheropportunities}

The following certificate programs complement well with ORFE and are
thus popular with students:

-   Applications of Computing
-   Environmental Studies
-   Finance
-   Optimization and Quantitative Decision Science
-   Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics
-   Program in Global Health and Health
-   Policy Program in Robotics and Intelligent Systems
-   Statistics and Machine Learning

### Talking Courses at Other Schools {#talkingcoursesatotherschools}

Students may take courses at other schools during the summer, during a
semester off, or during a year abroad. The rules are slightly different
depending on the activity. If you are considering taking a replacement
course during the summer or a semester off, you need to obtain a
Transfer Course Approval Form, from The Dean of the College website,
where you describe the course that is being taken, and what course at
Princeton is being replaced. This is particularly important if you want
the course to count toward some requirement. Read the form carefully. It
requires that you obtain the approval of the home department (or the
professor that teaches the equivalent Princeton course) for the course.
For example, if you wish to take a replacement course for MAE 305, you
should get the signature of the instructor teaching MAE 305 or the
Director of Undergraduate Studies from MAE. A replacement for an ORFE
course requires the signature of the Director of Undergraduate Studies
of ORFE. Approval that the course is equivalent or better than the
Princeton course, that is to replace, must be obtained by the Professor
teaching the Princeton course. Once received approval can be granted by
the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Please provide a syllabus or at
least a detailed description of the course before obtaining approval.

If you wish to take a semester or a year abroad, you need to obtain the
signature of the Director of Undergraduate Studies of ORFE, in addition
to the approval of the course of study committee.

Note, core courses (except for ORF 245) may not be taken at other
schools without special dispensation by the Director of Undergraduate
Studies. They must be taken at Princeton and must be taken "graded".
Departmental electives, if approved before taking, may be taken at other
schools; however, the grade earned will not be included in any GPA
calculation.

### Boris Hanin, Assistant Professor

I am interested in the theory of deep learning. Using tools from
probability and mathematical physics I try to understand key empirical
phenomena related to optimization, implicit bias, and generalization in
neural networks as well as to give practical and provable prescriptions
for architecture selection and hyper parameter tuning.

### Emma Hubert, Assistant Professor

The research in Applied Mathematics I have been conducting with my
co-authors during the past few years, has been motivated so far by two
main words: interactions and incentives. These two terms have to be
related in the context of my work to the Economics field, and in
particular when focusing on the behavior of economic actors. The term
interaction thus refer to interaction between consumers, workers, more
generally called Agents, through their decisions, their actions, the
price they pay for a service, or even through an external parameter.
When looking at interactions, the aim is generally to find an
equilibrium in this game between the Agents, so that no one has an
interest in deviating. This so-called Nash equilibrium can be extended
in the case of a continuum of Agents, and then reaches a more recent
theory borrowed from Physics, the Mean-Field Games. The term incentives
also have an economic content, and refer to the Contract Theory, and
more precisely to Principal-Agents problems. In this case, an Agent (he)
is delegated to act on behalf of a Principal (she). The Principal\'s
purpose is to find appropriate incentives, in the form of a contract, to
encourage the Agent to act in her interest. When considering these
issues from the mathematical point of view, the behavior of Agents, in
an uncertain environment and in continuous-time, can be modeled as a
stochastic control problem. My research so far is thus a continuous path
oscillating between Principal-Agent problems, Nash equilibria and
Mean-Field Games, using recently introduced and state of the art tools
in stochastic control. We study applications to Energy, Epidemiology and
Finance.

### Jason Klusowski, Assistant Professor

I am broadly interested in statistical and algorithmic problems that
arise in modern data applications. Specifically, my research seeks to
describe the tension between flexibility, computability, and accuracy of
large-scale predictive models, such as decision trees and neural
networks.

## Career Paths {#careerpaths}

Updates from ORFE Graduates

### Meghan Fehlig, '02

I\'m working as a transportation engineer in the transportation planning
department at Parsons Brinckerhoff (Princeton, NJ office). I became
interested in this field after taking Prof. Kornhauser\'s transportation
course and doing senior thesis research on the traffic woes of the Route
1 Corridor. Rarely a day goes by that I don\'t rely on something I
learned during my thesis research or ORFE courses, be it traffic
condition analysis, general research skills, MS Excel work, or NJ
transportation history. A real bonus about being in this field with an
ORFE degree is having a solid background in economics. Many of the
exciting transportation innovations are market-based solutions and my
ORFE studies have uniquely positioned me to work on these innovations
with a different approach from my civil engineer and urban planner
colleagues.

### Daniel Nash, '03

I am a Director of new Growth Platforms at Avery Dennison, a \$6.5
billion dollar manufacturing and consumer products company with
expertise in pressure-sensitive technology, and retail branding and
information solutions. As such, I am responsible for identifying and
building new growth opportunities for the company. For the past year, I
have focused on the healthcare industry, working to leverage Avery
Dennison's RFID technology to improve key processes in hospitals. Prior
to Avery Dennison, I worked as a consultant for the Boston Consulting
Group serving in both the Singapore and Boston office, and in the
Corporate Finance department of The Walt Disney Company. I received my
MBA from Harvard Business School in 2008.

My ORFE education continues to provide a significant advantage relative
to my peers. The ORFE department taught me how to quickly identify the
key drivers of a new market or successful product launch, so that I can
efficiently validate my assumptions and limit my downside risk. I
believe there is no better education for a successful career in
business.

### Katherine Milkman, '04

After completing my ORFE degree, I received a Ph.D. from Harvard
University\'s joint doctoral program in Computer Science and Business. I
am now an assistant professor at the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania where I teach undergraduates and MBAs about decision making
and behavioral economics. When I'm not in the classroom, I spend my time
on research that documents

various ways in which individuals systematically deviate from making
optimal choices. I am particularly interested in understanding what
factors lead people to undersave for retirement, exercise too little,
eat too much junk food, and watch too many lowbrow films. Recently, I
have also begun to study race and gender discrimination, focusing on how
a decision\'s context can alter the manifestation of bias. I have
published articles in leading academic journals such as Management
Science and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and my
work has been featured by numerous media outlets including The New York
Times, BusinessWeek, The Economist, and NPR. In 2011, I was recognized
as one of the top 40 business school professors under 40 by Poets and
Quants.

### Kimberly Mattson, '05

I am an Investment Associate at Bridgewater Associates, an institutional
hedge fund manager in Westport, CT. We deal with large institutions -
pension funds, college endowments, central banks. Most of my work
revolves around solving problems that deal with portfolio structuring. I
use a lot of the concepts I learned in ORFE in my day-to-day work. I use
a lot of the portfolio math I learned in ORF 435 to figure out a
portfolio\'s risk and return characteristics. We also have a tool that
calculates a client\'s optimal portfolio using a Monte Carlo simulation
process. I\'ve even used some of the ideas I developed in my senior
thesis, which used implied volatility in currency options to estimate
the chance of a currency crisis, in my job, since Bridgewater manages
currencies and options as part of its investment strategy. In my opinion
an ORFE degree is the most flexible major to have at Princeton because
it teaches a wide array of skills to apply basically anywhere after
college.

### Jacqueline Ng, '06

Since graduating as an ORFE in 2006, I have worked in a variety of roles
that have drawn upon the knowledge and skills I gained as an ORF major.
After graduation, I spent nearly 6 years at Morgan Stanley, where I
worked in US Government Bond Trading, Sales & Trading Strategy and US
Equity Research. During my time at Morgan, I also pursued an executive-
MBA at Columbia University. I recently left Morgan Stanley to work for
Microsoft in a strategy and finance type position for their consumer
advertising support business.

My undergraduate degree in ORFE has aided me tremendously in each one of
my job functions. At a high level, my ORF classes taught me how to think
quantitatively and analytically -- which has been a versatile skill that
has helped me grasp new concepts quickly in the workplace. The vigorous
ORFE curriculum prepared me well for the challenges of the workplace,
and has given me confidence when faced with complex problems.

On a more specific level, I find myself constantly drawing upon the
knowledge I gained in my ORFE classes. For example, Professor Sircar's
ORFE 335 class (Introduction to Financial Engineering) taught me
about various fixed income products and pricing models. As a bond
trader, I frequently used similar pricing models on a day-to-day basis,
in addition to various probability models, statistics and historical
regressions. Additionally, my undergraduate classes prepared me well for
business school, where my solid foundation in operations facilitated my
understanding of our operations management MBA coursework. Finally, in
my current role at Microsoft, I find that the knowledge I've gained as
an ORF major accompanies me both directly and indirectly in every
challenge and problem I face in the workplace.

### Raj Hathiramani, '07

Since graduating in 2007, I have worked in a few different roles that
have drawn upon valuable concepts I learned from the ORFE program. I
spent about 4 years working at Citadel Investment Group, first in
quantitative research and derivatives trading and later in fundamental
long/short equities, covering financial services. ORFE courses in
financial engineering and asset pricing were instrumental in
understanding how to value both stocks and derivatives.

After Citadel, I started working at Google, helping lead the sales
strategy and financial analytics for the company\'s display advertising
products. Prof. Carmona\'s class on regression and applied time series
enabled me to use R and SQL to analyze and set targets for Google\'s
revenue growth and present business insights to senior management.

Inspired by my managers at Google, I decide to pursue an MBA at Wharton,
where I am currently a first year student. While at Wharton, I have also
been working part-time as a portfolio consultant at First Round Capital,
a seed-stage venture capital fund, conducting strategy projects for
portfolio companies and assisting with diligence for the firm\'s
potential investments.

### Zachary Kurz, '08

I am working as an investment banking analyst in Morgan Stanley's
Mergers & Acquisitions Group. I am responsible for building financial
models in Excel and creating presentations for our senior bankers to
present to the Firm's clients. I have been part of some really
interesting transactions, including the recent \$46 billion merger of
Merck and Schering-Plough, two large pharmaceutical companies. I
frequently use a lot of the math skills I learned as an ORFE major and
the rigorous foundation has definitely given me a leg up on other young
people at the Firm. In particular, a lot of the programming skills I
acquired at Princeton have been incredibly useful. I am still unsure
about where my career is headed but I am eager to further immerse myself
in the financial world.

### Jonathan Lange, '09

I am an associate in the private equity group at Bain Capital. We invest
in market-leading companies in a wide range of industries and try to
optimize operations during our ownership. In my first year, I have
evaluated several interesting potential transactions, primarily in media
and technology. Prior to Bain Capital, I spent two years as an analyst
in the Technology, Media, and Telecommunications investment banking
group at Goldman Sachs, where we advised companies on mergers,
acquisitions, IPOs, and other financing transactions. Through my roles
at Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital, I have had the chance to travel to
across North and South America and work directly with management teams,
both as an adviser and investor. My ORFE education definitely gave me a
great foundation in financial modeling and has been a huge advantage as
I work through the theoretical aspect of valuation and the financial
impacts of potential transactions.

### Kate Hsih '10

At Princeton, I studied an interdisciplinary curriculum that treaded not
only in ORFE courses, but also in the natural sciences, global health,
and even the humanities. My goal was the develop a holistic
understanding of quantitative and qualitative approaches to interpreting
and solving real world problems. After graduating in 2010, I worked as a
Princeton ReachOut56-81 International Fellow with Wellbody Alliance
(formerly Global Action Foundation), a global health NGO focusing on
sustainable community-based health interventions in the rural
diamond-mining district of Sierra LEone. There, I was involved in a wide
range of projects

including HIV home-based care, reproductive health peer education,
social entrepreneurship in agriculture, amputee health, primary care in
resource-limited environments, and more. I also learned about what it
takes to operate a startup in this field and about the challenges and
complexities of navigating in a developing environment with different
cultural and professional norms. In addition to working in the NGO
space, I became interested in ethnography in Sierra Leone, particularly
on the topic of female genital cutting. This year, I am studying a
Master of Science degree in Medical Anthropology at the University of
Oxford prior to returning to the US for medical school.

While I have not directly applied many of the mathematical skills I
learned in my ORFE core courses, my engineering training is omnipresent
in managing my day-to-day operations. It shapes the way that I think,
analyze, and organize my thoughts when presented with new problems or
projects. Moreover, I have found that my ORFE degree and unusual
academic and extracurricular background has been an asset in finding
internship or employment opportunities because it allows me to bring
unique insights to the table. ORFE teaches students to model real-world
situations and make optimal and efficient decisions under uncertainty or
with limited information - these tools are necessary in virtually any
field, particularly in healthcare or global health. I encourage students
to consider using their ORFE education to pursue unconventional careers,
as it may open doors to greater responsibility and intellectual
creativity. I am happy to connect any students interested in the
healthcare, international development, or medical anthropology.

### Chetan Narain '11

I\'m working at Google on the Search Ads Quality team, which is
responsible for deciding which ads to show on the search result page and
thus brings in the majority of Google\'s revenue. The job is a blend of
engineering, computer science, and mathematics, which is exactly what
ORFE is all about. I\'ve worked on projects where we try to predict how
many people will click on an ad, something that requires substantial
data crunching, strong mathematical analysis, and a good understanding
of how people\'s minds works. My position is right at the confluence of
finance, mathematics and computer science, and was a natural extension
of the similarly multifaceted education I got in the ORFE program.

### Nathan & Natalie Keys '12

Natalie: After graduation I worked for Liberty Mutual Insurance as an
actuarial analyst. Some of my favorite projects were creating
statistical models of cost- saving initiatives in the claims handling
department, finding root causes of financial or operational trends and
developing predictive models, and assessing profitability for several
lines of business in different states.

ORF 309 and ORF 335 were directly applicable, as the material is in
several of the first actuarial exams. ORF 407, 409, 467, and 411 acted
as capstone courses - they gave me practice applying fundamental
probability and statistics, and a level of comfort with complex systems
and processes.

At the beginning of 2015 I joined a startup developing anti-collision
technology for heavy vehicles. I work from a Joint Venture office in
China, doing data analysis and programming.

Nathan: As an ORFE student, I drew many of my departmental electives
from the Computer Science department. After graduating I started working
for a small marketing analytics company in Seattle that builds and
operates omni-channel marketing campaigns large retailers. My role was
two-fold: first, I worked on the user interface team that developed the
web applications that our clients used to set parameters on their
marketing campaigns and evaluate their results through a rich reporting
and data analytics portal. Second, I participated in "productionalizing"
prototype code that the research team had written on our Hadoop big-data
analytics platform to help generate the data that was ultimately
presented in our user interface tool.

Most recently I have worked for a start-up company in China that is
developing anti-collision technology for heavy vehicles. My role
encompasses both directing and participating in technical product design
and development. In this role I supervise a team of developers, from
orienting them in our project, to defining, prioritizing, and assigning
tasks to them, in addition to working alongside them as a fellow
developer.

### Bryton Shang '12

Bryton Shang \'12 graduated from ORFE and after graduation started his
career in algorithmic high frequency trading. Shortly after, he started
his own algorithmic trading firm, and subsequently went into the tech
world, co-founding multiple startups as CTO. Five years after
graduation, he started Aquabyte, which uses computer vision and AI to
give aquaculture farms insight into the health, growth, and
sustainability of their fish. Bryton grew Aquabyte from an idea with a
prototype in his bathtub to a smart camera and data platform that helps
the world\'s fish farms understand what\'s happening in their fish pens.
His ORFE knowledge allowed him to develop statistical models that help
optimize fish growth and health over time.

In 2019, Shang was recognized as a Forbes 30 Under 30 leader in
Manufacturing and Industry.

### Anna Zhao '12

I work at the NBA League Office in the basketball operations department.

My department functions like the government of basketball, as we oversee
the on-court activities, manage rule changes, and address any questions
or concerns from teams. My most direct ORFE project has been when I used
my foundation in probability (ORF 309!) to evaluate teams' drafting
abilities (not gonna lie, I was pretty excited about this). Most of my
time has been spent on performing statistical analysis on a variety of
areas, such as injuries, the NBA Draft, and the NBA Development League.
Even when my job has no math involved, like stuffing All-Star Game gift
bags, what I learned about operations research helps increase
efficiency. I'm glad that I switched to ORFE because I learned how
to approach solving complex problems in real-world situations, how to
code to manipulate raw data into a useful form, and how to complete
tasks efficiently.

### Malavika Balachandran '13

I am working as an Analyst in the Securities Division at Goldman, Sachs
& Co. My team is responsible for structuring derivative products for
private individuals; I spend most of my day working with clients,
providing them with pricing on derivative packages, pitching trade ideas
that meet their investment objectives, and explaining how these complex
financial products work. It was through my ORFE education,

particularly my coursework in Financial Math, that I gained a strong
foundation in derivatives pricing theory, which governs the valuation of
the products I structure and sell. While I am not solving stochastic
calculus problems or developing pricing models every day, understanding
how the underlying pricing models work and how a position\'s risk and
price changes with respect to the input variables is extremely valuable
in my job. My interest in math and computer science attracted me to the
department, where I developed a strong intellectual interest in
derivatives pricing and computational finance, and I am very lucky that
I have the opportunity to apply my knowledge and passion in my career.

### Adam Esquer '14

After completing my ORFE degree in 2014, I began interning with the
Tampa Bay Rays almost immediately after school. I then signed on with
the team in a fulltime capacity later that year. I am a member of the
Rays' Research and Development Department. Being in a division with some
of the biggest market teams in the league (the Boston Red Sox and New
York Yankees), it is crucial that we maintain our edge in analytics to
continue to compete and succeed while only being able to sustain a
payroll that is one quarter that of our competitors. The Rays have
always been at the forefront when it comes to creating and applying new
methods of player valuation and on-field strategy,

and it is an honor to now consider myself a part of this group. The work
that we do affects everything from trades and signings to defensive
alignment and other strategies on the field. There is nothing more
rewarding than seeing the work that you do directly affect decisions
that are being made.

Looking back, I can think of no better course of study than ORFE to
prepare oneself for the sports industry. I think ORFE provides an
invaluable combination of having a strong theoretical background and the
technical skills to apply this more abstract understanding to real world
problems. From covering applied regression to simulation, ORFE got me
well ahead of where I needed to be to break into the sports industry and
succeed. The truth is that an ORFE degree can be applied in any
industry. ORFE is all about optimizing decision-making, and that basic
idea is pertinent to any front office of any company that you will ever
come across.
