## An Introduction to the Department

Humankind has always faced significant challenges. With today\'s technology, however, we have the ability to collect vast amounts of data to illuminate the problems and opportunities we face. More importantly, we now can apply an array of robust analytical tools to deepen our understanding of the issues, to help us make better decisions and to develop solutions that will enhance our quality-of-life.

While collecting vast amounts of data is becoming easier, collecting the right data remains very expensive. How does one get from vast data to the right data? How should one analyze, understand and appropriately address uncertainty that is present in essentially all societal endeavors? And, how can one exploit these resources to make the best possible decisions and best contribute to an enhanced quality-of-life? These are precisely the questions that form the core of the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering. Problems of this kind have appeared for a long time in the understanding of logistics and management, energy, the environment, agriculture, the military and micro- and macro-economics. As our ability to handle more data and complexity has expanded, so has our ability to more deeply address traditional applications and venture to tackle new ones in finance, health care, biology and most aspects of our society. The basic mathematical modeling and analytic skills that lie at the heart of ORFE are now essential prerequisites to almost any quantitative discipline, including areas such as data science and statistics, information technology, energy resource management, health care, risk management, and many others. We view ORFE as the ideal quantitative education for the modern world, whether you see your future as a business leader, health care provider, legal/policy/political professional, data scientist, quantitative analyst, or academic researcher. Even poets might find something to love in ORFE.

ORFE is the intersection of six closely interconnected applied mathematical disciplines and application areas that lie at the heart of all activities in the Department: operations research, financial engineering, machine learning, optimization, statistics and probability. Each of these areas is described in more detail below.

### Operations Research

The field of operations research traces its foundations to World War II, although it includes dimensions that go as far back as the early days of the telephone at the beginning of the 20th century. It uses mathematical models and optimization methods to rigorously address quantitative problems in business and management, logistics, health care, energy systems, telecommunications, and transportation. The most common theme that runs through these problems is the efficient management of resources, where resources may be natural resources, economic resources, informational resources, equipment, people, and/or physical facilities. Students in operations research may follow a management track into business or consulting, or a more technical path into teaching, research, or software development. There is a burgeoning marketplace for sophisticated methods to schedule airlines and railroads or to optimize supply chains for large manufacturing and retail enterprises.

### Financial Engineering

Financial engineering uses mathematical models of financial markets to design innovative financial instruments and strategies to meet the specific needs of individuals and corporations, including managing risks and cash flows. To this end, financial engineers analyze and ultimately manage risks within an integrated framework, as compared with traditional piecemeal approaches. Often, new instruments are constructed based on the specific requirements of the investor. Solving these problems in a principled manner requires a combination of diverse analytical methods from applied mathematics, probability and statistics, stochastic processes and stochastic calculus, optimization, financial economics, and computation skills. Students grounded in financial engineering are in great demand: they find jobs on Wall Street and with traditional financial companies such as banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and financial consulting companies, as well as in the CFO office within mainline corporations.

### Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a scientific field that aims to design computer programs and algorithms that can automatically learn from data and improve with experience. Machine Learning is routinely used to make fast and accurate predictions and decisions in problems whose scale is too large for humans to handle. Machine learning lies behind many recent technological advances such as self-driving cars, intelligent personal assistants, web search, credit risk analysis, customer preferences analysis and even genomics. At ORFE, we use mathematical tools to develop and analyze new Machine Learning algorithms to discover hidden structure in massive datasets and to make optimal decisions in the face of uncertainty and limited information.

### Optimization

Optimization is everywhere. Whether one talks about optimizing revenue, finding the best route to visit all the major cities of the United States, or optimizing the parameters of your new algorithm, there is common thread: one wants to design procedures that can rapidly and accurately optimize a given function of interest. The area of mathematical programming is concerned with the design and analysis of such procedures. At ORFE we are particularly interested in large-scale time-varying optimization problems, involving substantial uncertainty and variability. Indeed these problems are more and more important in
our \"Big Data\" era. We also pay special attention to the interplay between optimization and the domain specificity of the applications, whether it is finance, statistics or machine learning. The cutting-edge domain specific algorithms for large-scale optimization are nowadays critical to the success of most IT companies, this include Google\'s search engine or Netflix\'s recommendation system.

### Statistics

Statistics is the science of learning from data. Learning what? Well, almost anything: Statistics are behind drug discovery, political campaigns, climate policies, genetic screenings, financial portfolio management and quality control to name only a few. If your senior thesis involves data, statistics will be your best friend. Statistics is a universal framework to make decisions based on data. In the "Big Data" era, statistics is more relevant than ever: it allows us to make predictions and understand the inherent uncertainty associated to these predictions. Moreover, using modern computer resources, statisticians
have been able to contemplate richer models that fit better to reality and make ground breaking scientific discoveries, for example in understanding the human genome.

Hal Varian, the chief economist of Google, has famously said that the statisticians have the sexiest job of the 21st century. One advantage of working in statistics is that you can combine your interest with almost any other field in science, health, technology, or business. Most organizations now collect huge amounts of data and need statisticians to extract relevant information from them.

### Probability

Probability theory, also known as stochastics, is the mathematics of randomness and uncertainty. Probabilistic models lie at the heart of any application that involves uncertain outcomes, be it the arrival of patients and the availability of beds in hospitals, the fluctuations of financial markets, the spread of epidemics, the inheritance of genetic traits, and numerous other applications that span engineering and the sciences. They also provide the fundamental framework for modeling the structure of complex data, and form the foundation of statistical methods for analyzing text, speech, and biological data. At the same time, randomness can serve as an important resource for solving otherwise intractable problems, including simulation methods for estimating risks or for tracking and prediction in uncertain systems, random measurements for exploring customer preferences and for speeding up data acquisition in signal processing, and stochastic optimization algorithms for making optimal decisions on the basis of noisy data. Probability theory provides the tools needed to design and analyze such models and methods and to rigorously understand their behavior.

## Overview of the Undergraduate Academic Program

In addition to meeting the usual Engineering School requirements, students will complete courses in the following four groups:

* Departments core requirements (4 courses) -- These form the intellectual foundation of our field, and cover statistics, probability, stochastic processes, and optimization.

* Departmental electives (10 or 11 courses depending on senior thesis choice) - These are additional courses that either extend and broaden the core, or expose the student to a significant problem area or application closely related to the core program.

### Independent Research

* Senior Thesis - ORF 478 - A full year effort that involves a major application of the techniques in the program applied to a topic that a student chooses in consultation with a faculty advisor. Students interested in a full-year senior thesis must be willing to spend the appropriate time during both the fall and the spring semesters. Students who are unable to make adequate progress can switch to ORF 479 and be required to take eleven departmental electives. Students will enroll in the spring and will receive credit for two course grades given in the spring.

OR

* Senior Independent Project - ORF 479 (Spring semester only) - A short progress report will be due in January, (Dean's Date) to make sure that the students have chosen a suitable topic and matched up with their advisor. The final outcome will be a report due at the end of the spring semester. The report will fully describe the research project and its results. Typically projects will take approximately 30 to 50 pages. **(Also, students who take the independent project will need to take an additional 4XX ORFE departmental elective.)**

A minimum of 7 courses from the humanities and social sciences. These courses must include 1 course in 4 of the following areas:

* epistemology and cognition (EC)
* ethical thought and moral values (EM)
* historical analysis (HA)
* literature and the arts (LA)
* social analysis (SA)
* foreign language (107/108 level or above)

The University requires that 36 courses be taken to graduate. The School of Engineering requires math achievement through Math (MAT 103, 104, 201 and 202, or equivalent), Computer Science proficiency (COS 126), Chemistry (CHM 201 or 207) and Physics (PHY 103, 104). Ten courses required to meet the engineering school requirement of 36 courses (more if the student places out of any of the SEAS requirements). Students are free to select these courses from any department, and are expected to design an academic program with his/her advisor that produces a balanced education. No course may count under more than one heading, under any circumstances.

Each student selects and schedules courses in consultation with his/her academic advisor and the Departmental Representative. While generally no exceptions in the core courses are allowed, students may design specialized programs through their choice of departmental electives.

Specialized programs must be approved by the Departmental Representative.

### Graduate Courses

You may take graduate courses for purposes of scholarly enrichment. In order to take them you must complete the "Permission for Undergraduates to Enroll in Graduate Courses" form with signatures from the course instructor, departmental representative, and Dean Bogucki. The completed form is submitted to the Office of the Registrar during open enrollment period. Graduate courses do not count towards departmental electives.

You can find the necessary form here

### ABET Accredited Engineering Degrees

The Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering does not offer ABET-accredited engineering degrees. This has never been a problem for ORFE majors in their pursuit of post-graduate opportunities, and our B.S.E. degrees are fully accredited under Princeton University's overall accreditation. If, however, it is important that you major in an ABET-accredited program of study (e.g. for eligibility for an outside scholarship), please take this into account when choosing your major. Further information on which Princeton program of study are ABET-accredited, please consult the *Undergraduate Announcement*, <https://ua.princeton.edu/>.
